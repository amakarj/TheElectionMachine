# TheElectionMachine
This is our school project for Server Programming course. Task was to make an election machine using Java, JSP, HTML and Servlets. 

We decided to make candidate's and voter's view. 
Candidate can answer questions, edit and delete answers. They can also see profile and edit their information. 
Voter can answer questions and browse candidates. After answering questions, they see three most suitable candidates based on their answers.
