## My contribution in the project:

In the beginning of the project we designed the visual layout together using Figma. After that I created the design with HTML and CSS. I was the "designer" so I made many small commits in styling the pages which explains why I have more commits than the others. We all worked equally hard on the project.  

My main responsibility was to make database's Update function. I used that in candidates own profile page where I created a form which could be used to edit personal information. Besides the candidates profile page I was also involved in other parts of the project for example reading and saving answers from radiobuttons to database. We worked by ourselves and in some cases together as well- Specially in the last features of the project which were the hardest to cope with, we programmed  and solved problems together.

I participated actively in project planning and meetings and helped others when ever I could.
