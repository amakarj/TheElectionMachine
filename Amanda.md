## My contribution in the project work
First, we planned the project's visual together on Figma and set database ready to be used. After that Jenna created our project final look with HTML and CSS. 
My main task was to create a delete answers function for candidate's answers, so I worked mainly on that. 
I also participated in creating functions concerning the voter, e.g. reading voter's answers and saving them for comparison with candidate's answers.
When there was a major problems, often the whole team got participated in solving the problem together.

Overall, we communicated a lot during the project and were all the time aware what other members are working on. Everyone were present on each spring meetings.
