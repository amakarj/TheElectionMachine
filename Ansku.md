## MY CONTRIBUTION IN THE PROJECT

We started this project by planning the visual side together using Figma. This helped us to the same route.
We had a clear and common goal for which everyone in our team worked very hard. 

I have made the Browse Candidates-section. Jsp-files in this section bases on @jenhakk html-files. In this section user can browse the candidates
and also get more specific information about them. To get information needed, I made a method which selects candidates from database.

In the most difficult sections with the project we made close co-operation all together.
